You can find a demonstration of the project on medium.com/@nevacar

Any contribution or collobarotion is welcome. Especially, turning it into a web application is what I actually wanted at the beginning. However, I don't have time to learn how to do that. If you are experienced with web development, I can help you with how the code actually works. You can fork the project and do a little demo for web application and I'll handle the backend.

This is not the finished version of the project. Actually, this is only a beginning :)
